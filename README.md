# 🌍 Travel Customer Segmentation Project

## ✨ About This Project
This project was inspired by my personal experience traveling to several countries in Europe. I became interested in analyzing customer booking data in the hotel industry to **segment customers** and provide **business recommendations**.  

I use **Machine Learning (K-Means Clustering)** to group customers based on their booking characteristics, helping businesses gain actionable insights based on my experience.
